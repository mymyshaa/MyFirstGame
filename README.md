Magic Color App

Submitted by: Mayesha Fahmida

Name of my IOS App: Magic Color

Time spent: 5 hours in total


App Brainstorming: My favorite apps are  - 1) Instagram - Because I can scroll limitlessly, delete messages, and restore messages. It also has an AI search option now.
2) Temple Run - it's my favorite gaming app. We can change the characters. The characters can run too. We can change the audio, we can pause the game, and continue it.
3) WhatsApp - it's my favorite because it's very simple and secure. All messages are end-to-end encrypted. It's very private and safe.

I want to create a gaming app like Temple Run where I can change characters, the character should be able to move, run, jump, and do multiple tasks. I need features to change background colors, sound. Also, I can pause the game before it ends. There should also be options to chat with other players who are playing the game in different parts of the world. 



Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Because I used XCode for the first time in my life, I had difficulties finding different buttons like Adjust Editor Options. Also, I faced issues connecting UI to logic, submitting the GIF link, and pushing my project to github repo.
