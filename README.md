Time spent: 5 hours spent in total


App Brainstorming : 
I want to create a gaming app like Temple Run where I can change characters, the character should be able to move , run , jump and do multiple tasks. I need features to change background colors, sound .Also I can pause the game before it ends.



Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Because I used XCode for the first time in my life I had difficulties finding different buttons like - Adjust Editor Options. ALso I faced issues for Connecting UI to logic
